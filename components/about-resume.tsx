        I’m a third-year Bachelor of Engineering student at Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering, specializing
        in Electronics and Computer Science with Honors in Cybersecurity. I have a strong interest in full-stack
        development, cybersecurity, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Currently, I serve as the IoT Lead at our college
        club, Project Cell, where I guide and contribute to tech-driven projects focused on solving real-world problems.
        I’ve also completed an internship at Apraava Energy, where I gained practical exposure to industry practices and
        enhanced my technical and problem-solving skills. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to
        take on new challenges, learn continuously, and grow as a developer and innovator.
